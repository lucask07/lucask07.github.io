      <description>&lt;p&gt;Will, a sophomore from a small town in central Minnesota, is studying mechanical engineering and researching the electrical properties of conductive filaments for 3D printers. His primary interest is horology, but he also finds 3D printers, RC systems, and high powered rockets interesting. He codes well (even in C++)!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ian is a second-year student at St. Thomas, currently pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering.  His current responsibility is developing Verilog code for the COVG amplifier project. He is coding modules that will connect to a host computer using the Opal Kelly Front Panel interface, which allow the host computer to control analog to digital and digital to analog converters, through the use of an SPI interface and a Wishbone bus.&lt;/p&gt;
