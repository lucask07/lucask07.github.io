Voltage clamp techniques characterize ion channel electrical behavior by controlling membrane voltage while measuring membrane current. Cut-Open Vaseline Gap (COVG) is a specific voltage clamp technique that provides a unique combination of high-speed/low-noise needed to resolve fast protein dynamics and the rare ability to control both intra- and extra- cellular solutions. However, the COVG technique is regarded as challenging in part because the only commercial ampliﬁer is manually operated and requires considerable experience and skill. Further, this commercial amplifier is no longer supported. The COVG user community needs an easy-to-use, high-performance replacement that also makes the technique accessible to more laboratories. In this proposal, we will design, build, and test a new COVG amplifier that leverages modern digital electronics. This digital amplifier will use an innovative approach to automate experiment setup and to continuously adapt setup parameters during the experiment. These approaches will decrease the time required for experiments and maintain optimal feedback as system parameters evolve. The amplifier will have multiple inputs and outputs that are controlled and read digitally. These multiple signals will be used in digital signal processing and control systems algorithms to improve the speed of the ion channel voltage control and allow the experimenter to resolve faster dynamics. The modular ampliﬁer design will create general-use circuit building blocks with digital control systems for feed- back. These components can be leveraged by the electrophysiology community to extend this development to applications beyond COVG. This project will challenge students with instrumentation development that uses and develops skills in:\nCircuit design and simulations On the bench testing, FPGA coding and simulations PCB layout Control system implementation within an FPGA Python programming for instrument and FPGA control ","date":1732665600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1732665600,"objectID":"aa26951fe98a36a23501ee673277c880","permalink":"//localhost:60442/project/covg/","publishdate":"2024-11-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/covg/","section":"project","summary":"In this project we are leveraging modern digital electronics and control systems to create a new voltage clamp ampliﬁer instrument that automates experimental setup, provides digital feedback control, and captures low noise data of fast protein dynamics.

However, traditional amplifiers for cut-open oocyte Vaseline gap are labor intensive and require significant user expertise. We introduce an innovative, open-source digital amplifier system with high-speed digitization and software-controlled electronics for computer-driven automation. This system compares well to existing commercial systems in terms of conventional specifications of step response (current peak at 25 us and decay of 36 us time constant), current noise (1.0 nA at 3-kHz bandwidth), and dynamic range (96.9 dB). Additionally, it unlocks new methods through close integration of the amplifier and software, including machine-learning techniques for tuning capacitive compensation waveforms, achieving a 100-fold suppression of mean-squared transient current, and impedance measurement methods to identify system components such as membrane capacitance and electrode resistances. For future extensions, the design has unique attributes such as real-time digital signal processing for feedback, multiple input and multiple output, and allows for user customization. By providing open-source access to the circuit board designs, control software, and field-programmable gate array code on GitHub, this approach aims to foster cross-disciplinary collaboration and facilitate instrument customization enabling previously inaccessible electrophysiology experiments.","tags":null,"title":"Development of a digital amplifier system for cut-open oocyte electrophysiology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lucas J.

One class of SPCs based on the single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) detects individual photons using an avalanche process; the raw photon data can then be processed to extract scene information under extremely low light, high dynamic range, and rapid motion. Yet, single-photon sensitivity in SPADs comes at a cost—each photon detection consumes more energy than that of a CMOS camera. This avalanche power significantly limits sensor resolution and could restrict widespread adoption of SPAD-based SPCs. We propose a computational-imaging approach called photon inhibition to address this challenge. Photon inhibition strategically allocates detections in space and time based on downstream inference task goals and resource constraints. We develop lightweight, on-sensor computational inhibition policies that use past photon data to disable SPAD pixels in real-time, to select the most informative future photons. As case studies, we design policies tailored for image reconstruction and edge detection, and demonstrate, both via simulations and real SPC captured data, considerable reduction in photon detections (over 90% of photons) while maintaining task performance metrics. Our work raises the question of \"which photons should be detected?\", and paves the way for future energy-efficient single-photon imaging.

The direct ToF sensor measures the time for a brief pulse of light to return from the material with the intensity change and spatial and temporal spread of the returned light conveying information on the optical properties of the material. We use measured ToF histogram data of all five plastics, captured at a range of sensor to material distances, to train a classifier that achieves 96% accuracy on a test dataset. To extend the generality and provide insight into the classification process, we fit the ToF histogram data to a physics-based model that differentiates between surface scattering and subsurface scattering. Three optical parameters of the ratio of direct to subsurface intensity, the object distance, and the time constant of the subsurface exponential decay are used as features for a classifier that achieves 88% accuracy. Additional measurements at a fixed distance of 22.5 cm showed perfect classification and revealed that Poisson noise is not the most significant source of variation when measurements are taken over a range of object distances. In total, this work proposes optical parameters for material classification that are robust over object distance and measurable by miniature direct time-of-flight sensors designed for installation in smartphones.","tags":null,"title":"Plastic Classification Using Optical Parameter Features Measured with the TMF8801 Direct Time-of-Flight Depth Sensor","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Ian graduated from St. Thomas summa cum laude with a degree in Electrical Engineering and a minor in Physics (Spring 2023).

A histogram of photon return times is measured and then processed to estimate object depth. By collecting many photons that span multiple bins of the histogram the final depth estimate interpolates between time-to-digital converter (TDC) bins to produce a result that is more precise than the converter resolution. The precision of this interpolation depends on the temporal spread of the measurement, the resolution of the TDC, and the number of signal and background photons measured. There is a need for dToF depth precision models to guide design and predict and tune performance during use. In this article, we present models that estimate sensor depth precision versus dToF design parameters and photons measured. We use Monte Carlo simulations and experimental measurements to prove the accuracy of the models. With proven models in hand, we investigate a dToF sensor design by first presenting the dependence of precision upon the TDC resolution and the signal-to-noise ratio. Second, we experimentally measure the depth precision versus the intensity of background illumination. The models closely match the measurements of background susceptibility and locate a transition point of background intensity below which precision is constant and above which the precision continuously degrades. Finally, experimental measurements demonstrate how the modeling enables dynamic tuning: from a single histogram we estimate precision, thus enabling sensor exposure time tuning for a target precision or prediction of the precision given a change in object distance or background illumination. This work presents straightforward models verified by simulation and measurement. These models guide dToF design and enable dynamic adjustments that benefit power-constrained usage scenarios.","tags":null,"title":"Models of Direct Time-of-Flight Sensor Precision That Enable Optimal Design and Dynamic Configuration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lucas Koerner","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

A TAVR implant is ideally positioned to access numerous clinically relevant signals including arterial blood pressure, pulse wave velocity, electrocardiogram (ECG), patient motion, heart rate, respiration, and blood oxygenation. Unlike medical devices such as pacemakers, TAVR implants are purely mechanical structures with no sensing capabilities. In this work, we address this unmet clinical need by incorporating an Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) sensor network within a TAVR stent frame and designing sensor modules that can physically connect to the network at various landing zones. To illustrate this approach, we designed and built a sensor circuit board populated with a commercial inertial measurement unit (IMU) that can detect clinically useful metrics including pulse wave velocity at the aortic root. We use two spatially separated accelerometers to measure pulse wave propagation time with a standard deviation of 140 μs, which translates to an uncertainty of the pulse wave velocity of +/-0.2 m/s. The sensor modules connect to a customized stent frame containing the necessary I2C conductors. Our data suggest that a fully instrumented TAVR paradigm is feasible using this frame design and modular sensor approach.","tags":null,"title":"An Integrated I2C Sensor Network for Transcatheter Heart Valves","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ryan M.

Optical time-of-flight (ToF) depth sensors offer the potential for improved spatial resolution, however, ToF depth-sensing cameras may be too large and power-hungry for hand-held applications. We address this gap by experimentally evaluating an infrared ToF sensor (the ST VL53L1X) that uses a single-photon avalanche photodiode array to provide coarse spatial resolution while remaining miniaturized and low-power, thus allowing the generation of hazard maps in hand-held applications. We develop methods and present characterization results for distance measurement accuracy, noise, error, and tolerable ambient illumination. The IR ToF sensor sustains accuracy better than 2% up to a distance of 3000mm for a 73% reflective target in the presence of zero interfering ambient light. We characterize the spatial resolution enabled by this region-of-interest and find off-axis pointing of up to 15.7° in steps of 2.5°. Many hazard detection systems may be moving, which dynamically changes the position and pointing of the depth sensor. We demonstrate the use of a 9-degree-of-freedom (3-axis accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer) inertial measurement unit (IMU) to track sensor pointing. The ToF sensor combined with an IMU forms the basis for a miniaturized depth mapping solution that consumes 97.5mW when operating at 30Hz, and requires simple serial interfaces to a microcontroller.","tags":null,"title":"Characterization of a Miniaturized IR Depth Sensor With a Programmable Region-of-Interest That Enables Hazard Mapping Applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Logan Truman","Emily Whitwam","Brittany B.

The resistivity of these 3D printed samples depends on both the microscopic parameters of the carbon black filler and also on the macroscopic arrangement of the extrudites that build up the 3D printed sample. To investigate this dependence, we characterize the resistivity of five different printing infill patterns and find that a cross-ply pattern, which has extrudites oriented both in the direction of current flow and perpendicular to the direction of current flow has a lower resistivity of 0.229 Ohm m than the resistivity of 0.458 Ohm m found for a uni-ply pattern with all extrudites oriented in the direction of current flow. A Monte Carlo simulation of a large network of variable resistors illustrates the feasibility that the lower resistivity of the cross-ply pattern is caused by cross-flow which diverts current around areas of high local resistance. The same type of 3D printed conductive samples are tested as electromagnetic shields at frequencies up to 3.0 GHz using a custom-designed flanged coaxial sample holder. The shielding effectiveness of three sample infill patterns and four sample infill densities is compared. Cross-ply and angle-ply samples show the most efficient shielding effectiveness (normalized to sample density) of 17.5dB/g cm^3 at an infill density of 50% and would be the infill pattern of choice in an application constrained by weight or material.","tags":null,"title":"Conductive 3D printing: resistivity dependence upon infill pattern and application to EMI shielding","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Matthew was a UST Electrical Engineering Major who graduated in the Spring of 2020.

Here we show that the NSLS-II tools are not only useful for x-ray science at large-scale facilities by presenting an add-on package that adapts these tools for use in a small laboratory with common physics and electrical engineering instruments. The composite software suite eases and automates the execution of experiments, records extensive metadata, stores data in portable containers, and speeds analysis through tools for comprehensive searches. In total, this software suite increases the reproducibility of laboratory experiments. We demonstrate the software via the evaluation of two lock-in amplifiers --- the miniature ADA2200 and the ubiquitous SRS SR810.

The motion of a VCM is determined by the applied current as well as the mechanical parameters of mass, spring constant, and damping coefficient. VCM motion and mechanical parameters can be determined by a position sensor, but such a sensor may be too bulky for a miniaturized solution. To overcome this limitation, measurements of the VCM electrical impedance versus frequency can be combined with an electromechanical model to identify mechanical parameters. Here we detail an analytical model that relates the electrical impedance to mechanical parameters and demonstrate a miniaturized electrical impedance analyzer for VCMs designed around the AD5933 integrated circuit. The electrical instrument measures impedances of a typical VCM coil of ∼10 Ω with a signal-to-noise ratio of 84.7 dB. We display the effectiveness of the analytical model and impedance analyzer by identifying mechanical parameters of mass, spring constant, and damping coefficient using electrical impedance measurements alone. We experimentally modified the system mass and detected the changes using electrical impedance with a mean error of 5.6% and a Pearson's correlation coefficient of ρ = 0.95. Repeated measurements of a single VCM configuration demonstrated that the natural frequency, knowledge of which is critical for optimal efficiency, was detected with a variation of 0.2%. A departure from harmonic motion was observed at low velocities. We explain this departure by adding static friction to the model of VCM motion. The AD5933-based miniaturized VCM driver and impedance analyzer coupled with a model that relates mechanical motion to electrical impedance is a viable instrument for in-situ diagnostics and tuning of VCMs.","tags":null,"title":"An Embedded Electrical Impedance Analyzer Based on the AD5933 for the Determination of Voice Coil Motor Mechanical Properties","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Phil Kuplic","Lucas J.

The MMPAD offers advantages for SAXS experiments: a pixel full-well of \u003e2×10$^7$ 10 keV X-rays, a maximum flux rate of 108 X-rays pixel$^{-1}$ s$^{−1}$, and a sub-pixel point-spread function. Data from the MMPAD were quantitatively compared with data from a charge-coupled device (CCD) fiber-optically coupled to a phosphor screen. MMPAD solution SAXS data from lysozyme solutions were of equal or better quality than data captured by the CCD. The read-noise (normalized by pixel area) of the MMPAD was less than that of the CCD by an average factor of 3.0. Short sample-to-detector distances were required owing to the small MMPAD area (19.2 mm × 19.2 mm), and were revealed to be advantageous with respect to detector read-noise. As predicted by the Shannon sampling theory and confirmed by the acquisition of lysozyme solution SAXS curves, the MMPAD at short distances is capable of sufficiently sampling a solution SAXS curve for protein shape analysis. The readout speed of the MMPAD was demonstrated by continuously monitoring lysozyme sample evolution as radiation damage accumulated. These experiments prove that a small suitably configured MMPAD is appropriate for time-resolved solution scattering measurements.","tags":null,"title":"Small-angle solution scattering using the mixed-mode pixel array detector","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lucas J Koerner","Sol M Gruner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"b374a0708c615cbaf1104ce4aa0a3a75","permalink":"//localhost:60442/publication/koerner2011x/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/koerner2011x/","section":"publication","summary":"Dynamic X-ray studies can reach temporal resolutions limited by only the X-ray pulse duration if the detector is fast enough to segregate synchrotron pulses.

Because X-rays will arrive on femtosecond time scales, the detector must be able to deal with instantaneous count-rates in excess of 1017 photons per second per pixel. A low-noise integrating front-end allows the detector to simultaneously distinguish single photon events in low-flux regions of the diffraction pattern, while recording up to several thousand X-rays per pixel in more intense regions. The detector features a per-pixel programmable two-level gain control that can be used to create an arbitrary 2-D, two-level gain pattern across the detector; massively parallel 14-bit in-pixel digitization; and frame rates in excess of 120 Hz.

Rapid heating was achieved by initiating an exothermic reaction in multilayer foils comprising alternating nanoscale layers of elemental metals. The reaction occurred in a front ∼100 $\\mu$m wide which propagated across the foil at ∼1--10m/s. By using synchrotron x-rays focused to a small spot (60$\\mu$m diameter) and a fast pixel-array detector, we were able to track the evolution of phases in the reaction front during the initial heating transient, which occurred in approximately 1 ms, through cooling over a period of hundreds of milliseconds. In Al/Ni multilayer foils, the first phases to form were an Al-rich liquid and the cubic intermetallic AlNi (which likely formed by nucleation from the liquid). In foils of overall composition AlNi, this is the stable intermetallic and the only phase to form. In foils of composition $Al_3Ni_2$, during cooling we observed a peritectic reaction between AlNi and the remaining liquid to form Al$_3$Ni$_2$, which is the stable phase at room temperature and the final product of the reaction. This is in contrast to the sequence of phases under slow heating, where we observed formation of nonequilibrium $Al_9Ni_2$ first and do not observe formation of a liquid phase or the AlNi intermetallic. We also observed formation of an amorphous phase (along with crystalline ZrNi) during rapid heating of Zr/Ni multilayers, but in this system the temperature of the reaction front never reached the lowest liquidus temperature on the Zr--Ni phase diagram. This implies that the amorphous phase we observed was not a liquid arising from melting of a crystalline phase. We suggest instead that a Zr-rich amorphous solid formed due to solid-state interdiffusion, which then transformed to a supercooled liquid when the temperature exceeded the glass transition temperature. Formation of the supercooled liquid presumably facilitated continued rapid intermixing, which may be necessary to sustain a self-propagating reaction front in this system.","tags":null,"title":"Time-resolved x-ray microdiffraction studies of phase transformations during rapidly propagating reactions in Al/Ni and Zr/Ni multilayer foils","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Brian Rodricks","Boyd Fowler","Chiao Liu","John Lowes","Lucas J Koerner","Mark W Tate","Sol M Gruner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1230768000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1230768000,"objectID":"a55f50f7eb10dbe1119c01075421e4e3","permalink":"//localhost:60442/publication/rodricks2009quantum/","publishdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rodricks2009quantum/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A quantum-limited CMOS-sensor-based high-speed imaging system for time-resolved x-ray scattering","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lucas J Koerner","Mark W Tate","Sol M Gruner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1230768000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1230768000,"objectID":"aa05941af01386fb594ea8132fd8ac83","permalink":"//localhost:60442/publication/koerner2009accumulating/","publishdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/koerner2009accumulating/","section":"publication","summary":"We describe the development of a CMOS read-out chip for an X-ray pixel array detector that accumulates into analog storage elements with time resolution typical of synchrotron bunch spacings.
