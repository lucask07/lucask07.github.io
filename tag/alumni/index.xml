      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ian graduated from St. Thomas Summa Cum Laude with a degree in Electrical Engineering and a minor in Physics (Spring 2023). Ian is now an FPGA engineer at General Dynamics. In the lab, he developed Verilog code and advanced control systems design for the COVG amplifier project. He used MATLAB Simulink to create real-time fixed-point state space models that process ADC data to create outgoing data for the DACs. He also developed and tested modules that connect to a host computer using the Opal Kelly Front Panel interface, which allow the host computer to control analog to digital and digital to analog converters, through the use of an SPI interface and a Wishbone bus. As an undergraduate student Ian published two peer reviewed journal articles (with a few more to come)!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cienna is a student at St. Thomas undergraduate graduating in the Spring of 2024 with a degree in Computer Engineering and multiple minors! During the summer of 2022 she demonstrated successful classification of different types of plastics using a time-of-flight depth sensor (AMS TMF8801) funded by a UROP Young Scholars grant. In the process, she used TensorFlow to create classifiers that worked on input features of the raw histogram measurements as well as optical parameters of the materials as extracted from the return time histograms. Cienna is active in St. Thomas band and is a ECE department course tutor.&lt;/p&gt;
