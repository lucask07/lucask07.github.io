      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ian is a fourth year student at St. Thomas, pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering. His current responsibility is developing Verilog code and advanced control systems design for the COVG amplifier project. Currently, he is using MATLAB Simulink to create real-time fixed-point state space models that process ADC data to create outgoing data for the DACs. He has developed and tested modules that connect to a host computer using the Opal Kelly Front Panel interface, which allow the host computer to control analog to digital and digital to analog converters, through the use of an SPI interface and a Wishbone bus. As an undergraduate student Ian has published two peer reviewed journal articles!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cienna is a third-year student at St. Thomas pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering. During the summer of 2022 she demonstrated successful classification of different types of plastics using a time-of-flight depth sensor (AMS TMF8801) funded by a UROP Young Scholars grant. In the process, she used TensorFlow to create classifiers that worked on input features of the raw histogram measurements as well as optical parameters of the materials as extraacted from the return time histograms. Cienna is active in St. Thomas band and is a ECE department course tutor.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Will, a sophomore from a small town in central Minnesota, is studying mechanical engineering and researching the electrical properties of conductive filaments for 3D printers. His primary interest is horology, but he also finds 3D printers, RC systems, and high powered rockets interesting. He codes well (even in C++)!&lt;/p&gt;
